> Luigi Patruno is the only reason I passed AP Calculus last year. He tutored me in the subject for most of the year, and I watched my grades slowly climb twenty points at a time each test with his help. He was always calm and determined to teach me even when I was sure I would never understand a topic. He was certainly always surer of my success than I was.

> Luigi dedicated about two hours of his time to me a week, mostly on weekends. Not only was he willing to meet me every Sunday evening, but Tuesday afternoons as well. Though I would forget basic rules and theorems, like the basic definition of differentiability and the Fundamental Laws of Calculus, he never became angry or upset. He would just start over and find more ways to explain it. It was obvious how enthusiastic he was about math since he could come up with endless ways to describe the same thing.

> Luigi tutored my daughter Lyla several times for Business Finite Math and found it so helpful that we hired him for additional tutoring when she began taking Calculus.

> Genuine passion for the subject came across, which of course makes you, as a student, more interested and engaged.

Dan C., Student

> Obviously cared about what he was doing and how much we learned, and was able to share practical knowledge and experiences. Also, very clear explanations of all of the topics.
